# XL QA Challenge Response

This repository contains the solution to the **Xmarlabs QA Technical Challenge**, covering multiple aspects of software quality assurance for an e-commerce application.  
The work is divided into **Functional Testing, Regression Planning, Exploratory Testing, and Automation**.

---

## 📑 Challenge Overview

The QA challenge is structured into four parts:

1. **Functional Testing & User Story Analysis**  
   Documentation and test cases for validating user stories.  
   → See [`docs/part1-functional-testing.md`](docs/part1-functional-testing.md)

2. **Regression Testing Plan**  
   Strategy and prioritization for regression testing.  
   → See [`docs/part2-regression-plan.md`](docs/part2-regression-plan.md)

3. **Exploratory Testing (SauceDemo)**  
   Exploratory sessions, risks, and observations.  
   → See [`docs/part3-exploratory-testing.md`](docs/part3-exploratory-testing.md)

4. **Automation (E2E with Cypress)**  
   Automated end-to-end tests organized into mandatory and bonus scenarios.  
   → See [`automation/readme.md`](automation/readme.md)

## ✅ Summary

- **Functional Testing:** User story analysis and test cases.  
- **Regression Plan:** Structured strategy for ongoing validation.  
- **Exploratory Testing:** Hands-on testing of SauceDemo.  
- **Automation:** Cypress E2E tests with clear structure and evidence.  

## 🛠️ Tools & Methodology

### Use of AI Assistants

As part of this challenge, I leveraged **Microsoft Copilot** to support the following tasks:

- Formatting and structuring documentation (README files, Markdown organization).  
- Improving clarity and visual presentation of project materials.  
- Brainstorming alternative approaches to test design and documentation.  

All **reasoning, design decisions, and test implementations** were my own.  
Copilot was used strictly as a **support tool** to enhance productivity and polish the final deliverables.
